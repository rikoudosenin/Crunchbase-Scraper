Change url at line 39 with the saved searched url

The 5 second delay added when grabbing all url's from saved search is arbritrary. Feel free to wait for somekind of presence to reduce timing.

Only on one test I got hit with verification of press & hold after requesting 400 pages with 1sec interval inbetween each page.

Will clean up the code and proper functions later on. Or feel free to make changes yourself.

Don't try to login more than one twice in 1min on Linkeidn on the same IP. I haven't added captcha solver. Might later on but it's not a issue for me rn.
